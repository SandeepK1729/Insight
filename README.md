# Insight

My First machine learning project. By using this app anyone can get benifit of machine learning.

Insight is a machine learning project that utilizes Django REST framework as its backend and ReactJS as its frontend. The goal of the project is to allow non-technical users to train and save machine learning models based on their own customized datasets, and to be able to use these models to predict outcomes based on current input.

Overall, Insight provides a user-friendly way for non-technical users to leverage the power of machine learning for their own purposes, without needing to have extensive knowledge of machine learning algorithms and techniques.
